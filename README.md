- 👋 Hi, I'm @Dofp79
- 👀 I'm interested in cloud technology, intelligent process automation as well as data analytics.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning ASP.NET 6.
- 💞️ I am looking to collaborate on projects and gain more knowledge.
- 🐱‍🏍 I am currently working in the following areas:
   - Development of a software audit tool as an IT service management (ITSM) solution using PowerShell scripting and data warehousing. This project will provide me with a deep insight into 
     effective software license auditing and control, allowing me to apply my knowledge of UML analysis and design, as well as project management within the SCRUM methodology.
   - Organizing ITIL events to enhance the professional qualification and efficiency of the employees in the IT department where I am currently working.
   - Active involvement in the development of a web application using ASP.NET technology, following the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP), including the implementation of CRUD 
     operations and AJAX functionalities. Moreover, I am responsible for data storage and management using T-SQL. It's particularly rewarding that I am overseeing this project with the tools 
     from the combination of Azure DevOps and Visual Studio Pro.
